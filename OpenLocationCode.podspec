  OpenLocationCode-swift is an implementation similar to the code released by Google on their github repository for
  Open Location Codes (Plus Codes). Open Location Codes are generally 10 characters, but can be shorter (short codes,
  usually pinned to some nearby location that has a known prefix code) or longer (a full code with extra characters
  specifying grid-based reductions in the dimensions of a coded region). For more information about Google's Open
  Location Codes, see http://openlocationcode.com or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code
  or https://github.com/google/open-location-code
